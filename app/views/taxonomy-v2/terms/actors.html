      Actors
    </h1>

    <p>
      Actors are the people using or delivering the service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Actors include citizens engaging with a service, people engaging with a service on behalf of another citizen, DWP employees and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our services have multiple user groups. We need to design our services to meet the needs of all users - not just Citizen users, but the Agents and Professionals that interact with or help deliver the service to help achieve Citizen outcomes.
