      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">To be added:</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Priority 1</h3>
      <p>The first things we will create are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          goals (clearly defined, and aligned)
        </li>
        <li>
          measures of success (how we validate that we're doign the right things)
        </li>
        <li>
          content architecture (how we start taking a content-first approach, instead of retrospectively adding content in empty boxes)
        </li>
        <li>
          a Definition of Done (a list of things you should have done before you 'finish' a piece of content design to ensure consistent quality standards)
        </li>
        <li>
          logging design decisions (best practice, examples, suggested templates)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Priority 2 - to do next</h3>
      <p>The next things we will create are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          content debt (what it is, how we manage it, how it ties into research priorities)
        </li>
        <li>
          Health Terminology A-Z (language and terms unique to DWP Health)
        </li>
        <li>
          2i best practice (why, when and how to do 2i)
        </li>
        <li>
          a statement of purpose (what is a content strategy, how does it support the work we're doing in health, how content fits into the bigger picture)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Priority 3 - to review latert</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <p>Later, we will review and repriorise:</p>
        <li>
          principles for how we work (ways of working, promoting positive culture)
        </li>
        <li>
          Content Crit guidance (why, when and how to do a content crit)
        </li>
        <li>
          guidance on how we use the tools available for content design (style guides, design systems, and strategy for improving them)
        </li>
        <li>
          section to show our practice maturity (what we've achieved so far, where we are now, what we still have to do)
        </li>
        <li>
          milestones to review and update the strategy (should be an evolving artefact, not once and done)
        </li>
        <li>
          guidance on how we work with other areas (for example working with SPD, or external comms)
        </li>
      </ul>
